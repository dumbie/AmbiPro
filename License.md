# No license
If you find creative work (which includes code) that doesn't have a license the work is under exclusive copyright by default, that generally means you have no permission from the creators of the code to copy, modify, or share the code.

Unless someone includes a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, modify, or share the code without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs or litigation.

Although a code host such as GitHub may allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to copy, modify, or share the software for any purpose.
